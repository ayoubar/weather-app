# Vanilla JavaScript Weather Application

This is a vanilla JavaScript weather application I created as part of the SheCodes Front End Development curriculum. It uses geolocation and the Open Weather Map API to get data from the user and display the current weather conditions for that location. There are also working 3 hour and 5 day forecasts, as well as buttons which allow the user to convert the unit from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

# What I learned

* HTML5 and CSS3
* JavaScript features such as Functions, Arrays, Loops, Math and ES6 Syntax
* How to retrieve and display real data using an API, as well as Geolocation
* Used knowledge of Adobe Illustrator to import my own illustration to the project
